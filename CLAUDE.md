# CLAUDE.md

**Claude Code (CLI & Desktop App)** configuration for the vsp/SAP ABAP Harness Engineering project.

> **Doc intent:** This file is Claude Code-specific. Shared project context (build, codebase map, ABAP rules, Harness workflow) lives in [docs/context.md](docs/context.md). Agent roles live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Per-session skills live in [skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md](skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md).

## Session Start

At the start of every Claude Code session, run this checklist:
*(Ref: `docs/context.md` -> `Initial Context Files`)*

```
0. git config core.hooksPath .githooks         # activate hooks (run once per clone)
1. Read docs/context.md                        # full architecture map, ABAP rules, workflow
2. Read AGENTS.md                              # canonical agent roster
3. Read memory/MEMORY.md                       # recent session history (skip if absent)
4. Read skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md               # SAP development workflows
5. Read skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md       # mandatory QA chain after any write
```

## Claude Code: CLI vs Desktop App

Both the CLI and the Desktop App share the same configuration files and MCP server setup. Key differences, especially regarding hook behavior and UI features, are detailed in [docs/tooling-matrix.md](docs/tooling-matrix.md).

> **Hook limitation**: `PostToolUse` hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json` do **not** fire in the Desktop App. After any `WriteSource` / `EditSource`, run the Post-Write Mandatory Chain manually (see [skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md](skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md)) and sync via `bun scripts/dev-sync.ts`.

> **Linux developers**: Use CLI only —the Desktop App is not available on Linux.

> **Recommended split**: Use CLI for automated ABAP workflows (hook-driven, multi-agent orchestration). Use Desktop App for visual diff review, PR monitoring, and parallel sessions.

## Setup

> **Parent project**: [abap_vibe_coding](https://github.com/5throck/abap_vibe_coding)

1. **Install vsp binary**: Download from [vsp releases](https://github.com/5throck/vsp/releases) and place in your project root.
2. **Configure SAP credentials**: Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your SAP connection details.
3. **Enable MCP servers**: Ensure `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` is set in `.claude/settings.local.json`.
4. **Activate hooks**: Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (once per clone).

### Consumer Project Integration

When this plugin is installed in a consumer project:
- **Marketplace install**: SAP credentials are configured via `userConfig` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- **Manual install**: Copy `.mcp.json.sample` to your project root and configure manually
- **Hooks**: PostToolUse hooks fire in Claude Code CLI only (not Desktop App)

---

## Claude Code Settings

- `.claude/settings.json` —shared team permissions (committed to repo; note that `.claude/` is a hidden dot-folder and may not show in standard listing tools by default)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` —personal write permissions + git operations (gitignored)
- `.claude/commands/` —slash commands (`/sync`, `/memlog`, `/new-task`, `/triage`, `/transport`, `/post-write`, `/celebrate`, `/project-review`, `/meeting`)

Both files are loaded automatically. `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` is set in the local file to activate the abap MCP server.


---

## Hooks

A `PostToolUse` hook fires after every `Write` or `Edit` tool call and runs `scripts/sync-md.ts` (cross-platform via Bun). This hook is defined in `.claude/settings.json`.

| Environment | Hook fires? | Notes |
|-------------|:-----------:|-------|
| Claude Code CLI | —| Automatic on every WriteSource/EditSource |
| Claude Code Desktop App | —| Known issue —run Post-Write chain manually |
| Gemini CLI | —| Automated hooks disabled —run Post-Write chain manually |
| Antigravity | —| No hook support in VS Code extension |

`sync-md.ts` updates the `memory/MEMORY.md` index after every edit, ensuring session logs stay discoverable. It accepts optional `$DATE` and `$SUMMARY` arguments (defaults to today's date and `"update"`).


### Desktop App Manual Post-Write Chain

When using Claude Code Desktop App, PostToolUse hooks do not fire. After any `WriteSource` or `EditSource`, run this chain manually:

```
1. bun scripts/sync-md.ts           # update memory index
2. SyntaxCheck(<object_url>)        # verify ABAP syntax
3. RunUnitTests(<object_url>)       # run unit tests
4. RunATCCheck(<object_url>)        # ATC quality check
5. bun scripts/dev-sync.ts "fix: description"     # full sync: audit → commit → PR
```

See `skills/desktop-app-fallback/SKILL.md` for the complete fallback workflow.

### Optimal Interaction Guidelines
- **XML Tagging**: Utilize XML tags like `<thought>`, `<plan>`, and `<execution>` to structure complex reasoning and plans before generating final responses.
- **Tone**: Maintain an objective, highly analytical tone. Focus on systematic execution.

## Subagent Dispatch & 3-Tier Model Mapping

To fully leverage the 3-tier cost optimization strategy during execution plan creation and subagent dispatch, you must explicitly set the `model` parameter in `Agent()` calls using the correct short alias. 

**Registry Model ID to Short Alias Translation:**
- **High-tier (Design/Planning)**: Registry ID `claude-opus-*` → `model = "opus"`
- **Medium-tier (Review/QA)**: Registry ID `claude-sonnet-*` → `model = "sonnet"`
- **Low-tier (Execution/Coding)**: Registry ID `claude-haiku-*` → `model = "haiku"`

**Example `Agent()` Call:**
```javascript
Agent(
  model = "haiku", // Use short alias: opus, sonnet, or haiku
  description = "Code-writer for serial implementation",
  prompt = "..."
)
```
When dispatching subagents defined in `agents/*.md`, translate their configured tier into the corresponding short alias above.
