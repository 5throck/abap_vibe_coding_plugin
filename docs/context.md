## Project Overview

SAP ABAP Harness Engineering framework —a PM-led, multi-agent development harness for SAP ABAP projects using the **vsp** MCP server. Provides governance workflows, role-based agents, reusable skills, and automated QA chains for ABAP development.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| MCP Server | `vsp` Go binary v2.38.1 —connects to SAP via ADT (ABAP Development Tools REST API) |
| AI Orchestration | Claude Code CLI / Desktop App, Gemini CLI, Antigravity (VS Code extension) |
| SAP Connection | HTTP/HTTPS to SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP; configured via `.env` (`SAP_*` prefix) |
| Scripting | Bash (`.sh`) + PowerShell (`.ps1`) pairs for all automation |
| Documentation | Markdown —`docs/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `memory/` |

---

## Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Place the vsp binary in the project root
#    Download from: https://github.com/5throck/vsp/releases
cp /path/to/vsp ./vsp
chmod +x ./vsp          # macOS/Linux
# Windows: copy vsp.exe to project root

# 2. Configure SAP credentials
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env ??fill in SAP_URL, SAP_USER, SAP_PASSWORD

# 3. Activate git hooks
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# 4. Verify connection
./vsp health
```

Required env keys (see `.env.sample`):
- `SAP_URL` —SAP system base URL (e.g. `https://my-sap-host:44300`)
- `SAP_USER` —SAP username
- `SAP_PASSWORD` —SAP password
- `SAP_MODE` —MCP mode (default: `hyperfocused`)

---

## Upstream VSP Reference Build & Test

> **Note**: The following build and test commands apply to the upstream **vsp** Go engine repository, not this configuration/harness repository.

```bash
go build -o vsp ./cmd/vsp              # Build
go test ./...                           # Unit tests
go test -tags=integration -v ./pkg/adt/ # Integration (needs SAP)
make build-all                          # 9 platforms
```

Key flags: `--mode hyperfocused|focused|expert` (Note: `hyperfocused` is the standard mode for all AI agents), `--read-only`, `--allowed-packages "Z*"`, `--disabled-groups 5THD`

> **Note on hyperfocused mode**: Despite the name, `hyperfocused` mode registers all 101 individual MCP tools (GetSource, GetODataMetadata, RunQuery, etc.) —not a single unified tool. The mode restricts which SAP **packages** and **features** are accessible, not which MCP tools are registered. Agent files may reference all their tools normally when `SAP_MODE=hyperfocused`.

---

## Adding a New MCP Tool in Upstream VSP

> [!NOTE]
> This section is only relevant when contributing to the upstream vsp engine source repository.

1. Handler in `handlers_*.go`:
```go
func (s *Server) handleX(ctx context.Context, req mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {
    name, _ := req.GetArguments()["name"].(string)
    result, err := s.adtClient.Method(ctx, name)
    if err != nil { return newToolResultError(err.Error()), nil }
    return mcp.NewToolResultText(format(result)), nil
}
```
2. Register in `tools_register.go` with `shouldRegister("X")`
3. Route in `handlers_analysis.go` (or appropriate router)
4. Add to `tools_focused.go` if needed in focused mode

---

## Upstream VSP / SAP Runtime Common Issues

1. **CSRF errors** —auto-refreshed in `http.go`
2. **Lock conflicts** —edit handler does auto lock/unlock
3. **Session issues** —some CRUD/debugger flows are session-sensitive; verify stateful/stateless before changing transport or auth logic
4. **Auth** —use basic OR cookies, not both
5. **ZADT_VSP** —WebSocket debug/RFC/RunReport require it installed on SAP

> Security and sanitization rules are in [security.md](security.md).

## ABAP Development

### System Defaults
- System: NPL, Client: 001
- Host: vhcalnplci:50000
- ABAP Version: 7.52 (Verified via `vsp system info`)
- Package: `$TMP` (no transport required)

### Directory Reference

| Directory | Purpose | Git-tracked? |
|-----------|---------|:---:|
| `agents/` | Agent role definitions (`.md` files) for all AI tools | —|
| `skills/` | Skill definitions (`SKILL.md`) loaded per-session | —|
| `docs/` | Shared engineering documentation | —|
| `memory/` | Date-stamped development logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) | —|
| `scratch/tasks/` | Active task handoff files (created by `/new-task`) | —|
| `scratch/stable/` | Exported ABAP sources kept for reference (read-only snapshots) | —|
| `scratch/temp/` | Throwaway work files —not committed | —|
| `.agents/` | Claude Code plugin runtime cache (auto-generated by Desktop App) | —|
| `.claude/worktrees/` | Parallel session worktrees (auto-managed by Desktop App) | —|

### ABAP Development Rules
- **Naming**: `ZCL_` (class), `ZIF_` (interface), `ZPROG_` (program).
- **Isolation**: All local `.abap` files must be created ONLY in the `scratch/` directory.
- **Write Operations**: Use `EditSource` for small changes. Always run `SyntaxCheck` before `WriteSource`.
- **QA Chain**: After any logic change or edit, the `Post-Write Mandatory Chain` MUST be executed (`SyntaxCheck` —`RunUnitTests` —`RunATCCheck`). Priority 1 findings block deployment. See [skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md 吏?Post-Write Mandatory Chain](../skills/post-write-chain/SKILL.md) for details.
- **Final Audit**: Before any sync/commit, run the `sap:documentation-audit` skill.

### ABAP SQL Reference (All Agents)

> All agents that run `RunQuery` MUST follow these rules.

```sql
-- ??Correct ordering
ORDER BY field DESCENDING        -- NOT: ORDER BY field DESC

-- ??Row limiting (use max_rows parameter, not SQL LIMIT)
RunQuery(sql=..., max_rows=50)   -- NOT: LIMIT 50 in SQL string

-- ??Date format
WHERE erdat >= '20260501'        -- YYYYMMDD string, no separators

-- ??Table aliasing in JOINs
FROM vbak AS a JOIN vbap AS b ON a~vbeln = b~vbeln

-- ??Field references with tilde
b~matnr    -- NOT: b.matnr

-- ??Anti-patterns to avoid
SELECT *                         -- always list explicit fields
MANDT = '001'                    -- never hardcode client
```

### Developer Quick Start (Task Lifecycle)

For full project governance and role-based orchestration, refer to [AGENTS.md 吏?Collaborative Workflow](../AGENTS.md#agent-coordination-workflow-harness-advanced).

```powershell
# 1. Initialize Task
..\scripts\vsp-task.ps1 -Name "Task Description"

# 2. Execution (Research -> Implementation -> Verification)
# Use specialized skills from skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md

# 3. Synchronize & Commit
..\scripts\vsp-sync.ps1 -Message "feat: implementation summary"
```

---

## Task Handoffs: `scratch/tasks/task-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN.md`. Memory Logs: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. SAP objects: `ZADT_<nn>_<name>`, `ZCL_ADT_<name>`, packages `$ZADT*`.

---

## Coding Guidelines

> These rules apply to every AI tool working in this project.
> Full rationale: [CONSTITUTION.md 吏?](../https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5throck/ai-workspace-standards/main/CONSTITUTION.md#8-coding-behavior-guidelines)

### 1. Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. If uncertain, ask —don't guess silently.
- **Secrets**: Never hardcode passwords, API tokens, or keys. Always use env vars / `.env.sample`.

### 2. Simplicity First
- Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

### 3. Surgical Changes
- Touch only what is necessary. Don't "improve" adjacent code.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Convert every task into a verifiable goal before starting.

### 5. Response Language
- All **conversational** replies —**Korean (—볥럢—** by default.
- All code, config, commit messages, PR titles, branch names, **CHANGELOG.md**, and **memory/ logs** —**English only**.

---

---

## Project-Wide Rules (All Tools)

> These rules apply equally to Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Antigravity, and any other AI tool operating in this project. Tool-specific overrides live in `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.codex/`.

### Memory Logging

Whenever an ABAP program, class, interface, or other object is **created or significantly changed**, append an entry to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Required fields per entry:
- **Object name, type, package, and ADT URL**
- **Purpose summary** (what it does, what it queries, how it outputs)
- **Key technical decisions** (design choices, reasons, alternatives considered)
- **Issue history** (symptom —root cause —resolution)
- **MCP / config changes** (`.mcp.json`, `.gemini/settings.json`, etc.)

**When to read**: Only when a recurring error occurs or when uncertain about a past design decision. Do **not** read memory files on every session start. All entries must be written in **English**.

**Scope boundary** —`memory/` and `CHANGELOG.md` serve different purposes and must not be conflated:

| Change type | Record in |
|-------------|-----------|
| ABAP object created or significantly modified | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Harness infrastructure changed (agents, skills, scripts, docs, config) | `CHANGELOG.md` —`[Unreleased]` section |

### Documentation Language

All `.md` files must be written in **English**. **Exception**: files whose name contains `_ko` (e.g., `README_ko.md`) must be written entirely in Korean.

**Git artifacts** (commit messages, PR titles, PR body, branch names, code review comments) must also be written in **English** at all times, regardless of the language used in conversation with the user.

### Documentation Synchronization

`docs/context.md` is the **single source of truth** for shared engineering content.

| Change type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Shared content (build, codebase, rules, issues) | Update `docs/context.md` only |
| Tool-specific config or skill | Update `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `.codex/` only |
| Agent roles or workflow | Update `AGENTS.md`; reflect summary in `docs/context.md` |

Do **not** copy shared sections from `docs/context.md` into tool-specific files.

### Git Reflection

All development artifacts (ABAP sources, docs, research reports) and memory logs must be committed to the local Git repository. The PM agent verifies repository status and memory file existence at the end of each major task.

### Tooling Matrix

For a full comparison of tool capabilities (Claude Code CLI vs Desktop App vs Antigravity vs Gemini CLI) and hook behavior by environment, see [docs/tooling-matrix.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5throck/abap_vibe_coding/main/docs/tooling-matrix.md).

## Areas Requiring Care

| Area | Risk | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `pkg/graph/` | New, incomplete | Only parser adapter; SQL/ADT adapters pending |
| `handlers_debugger.go` | WebSocket-only | REST breakpoints 403 on newer SAP; use ZADT_VSP |
| `handlers_amdp.go` | Experimental | Session works, breakpoints unreliable |
| `pkg/adt/ui5.go` | Read-only | Write needs `/UI5/CL_REPOSITORY_LOAD` |
| `pkg/llvm2abap/`, `pkg/wasmcomp/` | Research | Not production; don't treat as stable |
| `pkg/adt/debugger.go` (REST) | Deprecated | Prefer `websocket_debug.go` |
| `../agents/*` | Config drift | Codex TOML format may differ from Claude/Gemini JSON docs |
| `.codex/config.toml` | Tool parity | Keep MCP servers, hook enablement, and `skills/abap-dev/SKILL.md` skill loading aligned with Claude/Gemini settings |

*Last Updated: 2026-05-24*


### Tracking Management: CHANGELOG vs. Memory
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**: For end-users and release notes. Record *what* changed (features, fixes) using structured categories. **(Must be written in English)**
- **`memory/` logs**: For developers and AI agents. Record *how* and *why* changes were made, including architectural decisions and debugging context. **(Must be written in English)**

### Auto-Updating & Context Maintenance
- **Trigger**: Agents MUST automatically append a summary to the `memory/MEMORY.md` or update architecture sections in `docs/context.md` whenever a significant architectural decision or multi-file feature is completed.
- **Archiving**: If `docs/context.md` or logs become too unwieldy, older decisions should be archived to `docs/history.md`.


## Dynamic Roster & Skills Note
**Note:** The agent and skills lists in this project may be dynamically expanded by the PM orchestrator during the Kickoff Phase based on emerging requirements.


### 8. File Encoding Rule (Markdown & Scripts)
- All text files, including Markdown (.md) and scripts (.ps1, .sh, .py, .js, etc.), must be saved as **UTF-8 (without BOM)**.
- Script outputs (Add-Content, Set-Content) must explicitly specify -Encoding UTF8.

### 9. Hybrid Scripting & Cross-Platform Rule

This project uses a **Hybrid Scripting Automation** model:
1. **Utility Scripts (Everyday sync/audit)**: Implemented in pure PowerShell (`.ps1`) and Bash (`.sh`) for ease of use without external dependencies.
2. **Agent Orchestration**: Complex multi-agent workflow coordination and error handling logic are implemented in TypeScript (`.ts`) and executed via Bun.

**Script Pairing Rule**:
- Any modification to a `.ps1` utility script MUST be accompanied by the exact same logical modification to its `.sh` counterpart, and vice versa.
- A script should never exist in only one format unless it is an OS-specific installer.
- **Agent Orchestration** `.ts` files do not require PS1/SH pairs.
